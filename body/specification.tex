\chapter{Product Specification}

Explaining what your project is meant to achieve, how it is meant to function, perhaps even a functional specification.
To aid in the design and development of this software system, both functional and non-functional requirements have been specified. Following Agile software development practices, the requirements have been specified in the form of User Stories. The requirements as defined below will be used for validation in User Acceptance Testing as the project progresses.

\section{Functional User Stories}
\begin{itemize}
  \item As a group-chat member, I want to tag other members in my messages so that they know there are actions for them.
  \item As a user, I want my login details to be remembered so that I don't have to type them in every time I open the application.
  \item As a non-technical person, I want the set-up process to be as simple as possible so that I can do it myself and get started quickly.
  \item As a student living in a shared house, I want to have multiple people in a conversation so that I can talk to all of my housemates at once.
  \item As a message recipient, I want to reply directly to messages so that other people in the conversation can clearly see what I am referring to.
  \item As somebody who travels a lot, I want to send files to people so that I can share photos and videos of my trips.
  \item As a security conscious user, I want to send end-to-end encrypted messages so that only me and the intended recipient(s) can read them.
  \item As an existing email user, I don't want my existing email inbox to be affected so that I can continue to use traditional email alongside this software.
  \item As a message sender, I want to remove files from a message before sending it so that I don't send files that I selected by mistake.
  \item As a user with lots of friends, I want to be able to have multiple conversations on the go at a time.
  \item As a message recipient, I want to see which messages I have read and which I haven't so that I can make better use of my time.
  \item As a user, I want messages to appear in conversations in the order that they were sent so that I can follow the conversation flow.
  \item As a group-chat member, I want to add new participants so that they can see the messages in the group and read new ones.
