\begin{abstract}

This report documents the progress that has been made so far on creating a piece of software for federated small group communication. The software uses email as the underlying transport mechanism, since this can be considered the ultimate federated system. A significant amount of work has been completed towards the design, both architectural and user interface, and implementation of this system, including unit testing. The project is currently progressing at a good pace, and it is expected that the full scope can be completed within the time constraints imposed.
