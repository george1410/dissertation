%%%%%%%%%% NEED TO UPDATE FROM INTERIM %%%%%%%%%
This report documents the progress that has been made thus far towards creating an application to enable federated small group communication. The application uses email protocols as the underlying transport mechanism, since this can be considered the ultimate federated system due to its pervasive nature. A significant amount of work has been completed towards the design, both architectural and user interface, and implementation of the system, including unit testing. The project is currently progressing at a good pace, and it is expected that the full scope can be completed within the time constraints imposed.
