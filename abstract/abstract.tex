\begin{abstract}
With social media style applications such as WhatApp and Facebook becoming the most popular form of communication, especially for small groups, security and privacy concerns have grown in recent times. The vast majority of services such as these have the prerequisite that users must have an email account. Email in its current form, and the existing clients for it, does not provide a rich enough feature-set to rival the growing communications services especially when it comes to conversations with many participants. This project aims to take advantage of the federated communication network that is inherently available through email to create a new client application to enable messaging in a style similar to Facebook or WhatsApp, but using email protocols and addresses as the underlying transport mechanism. By integrating directly with email accounts, and providing end-to-end encryption as standard, this project presents an alternative form of communication that ensures that the privacy of users is maintained.
